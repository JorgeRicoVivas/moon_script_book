# Moon Script

This is a very basic scripting language for simple behaviour with some
syntax based on Rust's.

It doesn't mean to compete with other scripting languages implemented
in Rust like Rhai or dyon, and therefore lacks many features these
have.



Moon Script doesn't allow creating custom types like Rhai would, but allow
to create 'associations', which are values that can be represented through
a primitive and to have special functions on them, for example, an 
identification can be expressed as the primitive 'array' with values
[name: String, age: integer].
