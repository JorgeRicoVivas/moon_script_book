# Returning values
Like in Rust, you can return a value either by writing a ``return`` statement:

```rust
let a = 5
return a //Returns 5
```

```rust
return 5 //Returns 5
```

<br>

If the last statement yields a value, it also returns it like in Rust:

```rust
let a = 5
let b = 0
a //Returns 5
```

```rust
a = 10
5 //Returns 5
```
